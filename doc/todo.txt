(A) Implement new processor which spits tabs as SVGs (files per page). +NewFeature
(A) Extend repeat tag, making it also accept the construction '.repeat{<part>}{"+"|"-"<number>".5"}'.
    The second part will be responsible for the transposition stuff. Thus, '.repeat{outro}{+3.5}' will transcribe
    'outro' part 3 steps 1/2 higher than the original part. +NewFeature
(Z) Implement a new processor which spits tabs as JPEGs (files per page, it would be useful for Kindle stuff). +NewFeature
x (A) Implement test cases for null appends and part tag following v7 syntax: '.part{<label>}{<code-chunk>}'. +Tests
x (B) Change part tag to a more sane definition/usage: '.part{riff-i}{<code>}'...'.repeat{riff-i}'.
      Trying to keep backward compatibility with its previous insane implementation. +Redesign,+BackwardCompatWhat?,+Improvement
x (A) Fix SIGSEGV when appeding a null script into another, e.g.: '.append{}'. +BugFix,+Improvement
