(Z) Implement a new processor which spits tabs as JPEGs (files per page, it would be useful for Kindle stuff). +NewFeature
x (D) Create v7 tag. +SCMStuff,+SanityKeeping,+ReleaseStuff
x (C) V7 prebuilt for Windows. +ReleaseStuff
x (C) V7 prebuilt for Linux. +ReleaseStuff
x (C) V7 prebuilt for FreeBSD. +ReleaseStuff
x (B) Change the syntax highlighting for 'shifted-repeats'. +MinorImprovement
x (A) From now on start maintaining a plain ascii version of release notes ('RELNOTES.txt') located at the
      project's top-level directory. +MinorImprovement,+SanityKeeping
x (A) Add some test for 'shifted-repeats'. +Tests
x (A) Extend repeat tag, making it also accept the construction '.repeat{<part>}{"+"|"-"<number>(<number>*|".5")}'.
      The second part will be responsible for the transposition stuff. Thus, '.repeat{outro}{+3.5}' will transcribe
      'outro' part 3 steps 1/2 higher than the original part. +NewFeature
x (A) Create some unit test for --out=foobar.html --svg. It will nice for testing SVG page breaking stuff, too. +Tests
x (A) Create an alternative HTML output that combines SVG stuff to produce a page navigation like a slide show.
      It must be a self-contained HTML. +NewFeature
x (A) Implement new processor which spits tabs as SVGs (pages per file). +NewFeature
x (A) Implement test cases for null appends and part tag following v7 syntax: '.part{<label>}{<code-chunk>}'. +Tests
x (B) Change part tag to a more sane definition/usage: '.part{riff-i}{<code>}'...'.repeat{riff-i}'.
      Trying to keep backward compatibility with its previous insane implementation. +Redesign,+BackwardCompatWhat?,+Improvement
x (A) Fix SIGSEGV when appeding a null script into another, e.g.: '.append{}'. +BugFix,+Improvement
