# Contributing guidelines

First of all, thank you for being interested in contributing with your brain, fingers, experience and the most
valuable thing: ``some time of your life``.

Maybe you have a great idea to put working on here. Anyway, before starting to dive into the code, take in consideration
these following aspects:

    - My idea will break with every thing done before, users will need to re-write a bunch.
    - I will implement a stuff because ``me``, ``myself`` and ``irene`` judge important.
    - I do not have any experience with music, however, I think that my idea could be profitable for the users.
    - I will re-implement a thing that is incorrect according to a book that I recently read.
    - I want to add some trend fancy testing idea here, because everyone is using.

All listed aspects are bad... If your "idea" fits with or more of them, I still say thank you, but no.

If you have some idea but do not have any musical knowledge, you still can contribute open an [issue](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/tulip/issues)
and talk about it. I will be really interested to known more.

Otherwise if your idea still "remains the same" :) Welcome! The first thing to do is read the code and ask when you do not
understand something.

Important things here:

    - Be creative. You are not a robot.
    - Give focus to the concepts not to the "bread pan". Again, you are not a robot.
    - Code to transfer to the binary some aspects of your own knownledge. By the way, this is the primary reason for being code something.
    - Use what you write. Really! Install it! Annoy yourself before annoying other people!
    - Be clearer but not boring.
    - If the knowledge that you need to put here is demading, do not be shy. If it is well-documented it is ok. Do not limit your code, just because someone will need to learn more before understanding you.
    - The only nice lazy creatures that I know are cats.
    - Reading before writing is essential.
    - New features, new documentation or a least the old documentation should be updated.
    - Pull requests are welcome. Talk about your work on it is essential. You are still interested in what you did. Right?
    - This is about compilers, language, toy-programming. Point-and-click things already exist. If you really want to do a point-and-click stuff. Congrats, you got a new project or several projects to contribute outhere!
    - Tests are good.
    - Write tests seeking to garantee that no one (you, larry, curly, moe, your cat or fresh vegetables) can deploy what you wrote broke.
    - Paranoic, pedantic, useless tests are boring.
    - A memory leak is vulgar. Pretty vulgar.
    - "- Man, this memory leak tool is crazy!!!". Excuses are good to laugh at.
    - A bureaucratic idea works better than chloroform.
    - [Suckless.org](http://suckless.org/philosophy) has a good point to consider.
