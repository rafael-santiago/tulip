1. Latest releases are in the top.
2. Usually, I try to do my best in order to bring you 'RELNOTES' instead of notes from hell ;)

v7 [git-tag: 'v7']

    Features:

        - New SVG processor.
        - HTML processor can also embed SVG TABs and including a rad viewer for them, too. You can easily navigate through
          the pages of your transcription. It could be quite nice when studying, remembering old transcriptions, etc.
          It can be awesome if you do not have a nice SVG viewer or want to produce a more device-independent output but
          keeping on some fancy stuff that would be dropped out in plain ASCII TABs.
        - New '.part' tag extension that makes possible to mark-up a more arbitrary song part instead of just the last written
          section.
        - Now 'shifted-repeats' are possible by using: '.repeat{<part>}{+|- <tones total> [.5]}'.
        - For the sake of my sanity, now release notes are being stored into 'RELNOTES.txt', too.
        - Minor changes in syntax highlighting files related to 'v7' language extensions.

    Bugfixes:

        - Some options related to tuning info were not being properly read when explicitly passed by command line, due
          to a pre-historic dummy typo ('tunning' instead of 'tuning') [commit-id#e537ef].
        - HTML and Markdown processors was writing incomplete TABS. The problem was in TXT processor, where sometimes NULLs
          were being written to output. [commit-id#6ffe59].

v6 [git-tag: 'v6']

    Features:

        - Support for code inclusion by using the tag '.append'.
        - Support for comments by using the comment token '%'.

    Bugfixes:

        - None! :)

v5 [git-tag: 'v5']

    Features:

        - Improvements on typesetting for 'bend' and 'release bend' techniques ('Postscript/PDF' out).
        - Support for Latin1 symbols for the '.literal' tag ('Postscript/PDF' out). '.literal{"É isso aí..."}'.

    Bugfixes:

        - None! :)

v4 [git-tag: 'v4']

    Features:

        - `Postscript` processor.
        - `Encapsulated Postscript` processor.
        - `PDF` processor (need `pspdf` tool).
        - `Markdown` processor.
        - `HTML` processor.
        - Minor improvements on `ASCII` processor heuristics'.
        - Separating the master tuning indication from the Tablature's notation table.

    Housekeeping:

        - Making easier the addition of new typesetting testing steps.
        - Minor build improvement: bypassing `Valgrind's` still reachable reports.

    Bugfixes:

        - Comments line breaking [commit-id: #3fdc225].
        - Repoprefs loading [commit-id: #34fa61a].
        - Muffled notes considered kTlpTimes [commit-id: #e1ac632].
        - Tuning that mixes natural and half step notes [commit-id: #a59f61d].
        - Tuning loading [commit-id: #9b2a31c].
        - `.tunning` -> `.tuning` [commit-id: #cab8763].

v3 [git-tag: 'v3']

    Features:

        - Compiler re-written from scratch.
        - Now generating object code instead of dumping the Tab directly by the user's code (I was a damn crazy... ?_?).
          A pretty simple Processor's "machine code" was introduced.
        - Speed improvements. Running the compilation step in just one single pass (the old compiler had two).
        - Text processor (`ASCII` Tab) re-written from scratch.
        - Formalizing a little the `DSL`.
        - New tags added to the `DSL`. Tags related with repetition. They are: `@` (once more), `.part` and `.repeat`.
        - Processor behavior now is controlled with command line option and/or "repoprefs" instead of a "set section".
        - New typesetting heuristics' besides some improvements on the old ones.
        - Now `FreeBSD` is a supported platform.
        - `MIDI` support stripped out.

    Housekeeping:

        - A more decent build: Test for typesetting's consistency, Installing/Uninstalling, Prebuilts, etc.

    Bugfixes:

        - All old bugs had gone! I have not seen any new... ¬¬
